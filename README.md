# Geo Scripts

These are random scripts I've written to do various things (at this
point, mostly building game maps).

All this stuff is licensed under the Creative Commons license; if
anything here seems useful to you, feel free to grab it and modify for
your own use as you see fit.  But if it don't work for you, well,
you're also on your own.  I'll help you get it working if I can, but
ultimately, I make no guarantees of any sort.
