# geo-scripts

These are just random scripts I've written that I'm open-sourcing because someone else might find them useful (though I haven't put any real effort into generalizing them or anything; I've written them for my own specific uses).

Feel free to use them however you want, give me credit or not, I don't care. I also give no warrantees -- even though I'd hope it doesn't, if the code breaks for you, you're on your own.
